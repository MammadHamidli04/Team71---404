        For teaching coding different platforms are being used, and we

        during Hour of code. Hour of code is an hour of introduction to computer
        science. During this project each group had to choose a community, and
        then organize this event there. In the teaching process a maze puzzle
        was used and before teaching we ourselves completed tasks in code.org
        and gained experience. The main idea of this project is to teach kids
        easy programming skills and algorithms, and also encourage kids to learn
        computer science. To read our experience and what we did during this
        event scroll down.

          To start about our experience, every groupwork starts with finding
          time suitable for each team member. For us it was one of the hardest
          stages. After this our challenges continued with finding school. After
          talking with several schools we choose to go to Baku Young Talents
          Lyceum. We choose younger -aged kids because they have lots of time to
          improve their knowledge.
          <br />

          During the hour of code first we talked about ADA university. After
          informing about ADA we started explaining the topic. Via providing
          slides prepared by us, also via solving questions from maze puzzle
          kids understood the topic perfectly. For them to better understand we
          helped them in case if kids had questions. For creating a competitive
          environment, we gave kids exact tasks and who completed first had a
          chance to explain questions to classmates. Though it was a great
          experience, of course we had some struggles too. We had struggles with
          kids interested in programming. They tried to solve everything fast
          and then not listen to us. But we could solve these problems, keep the
          attention of students, even make them raise both hands or clap to keep
          focused. In addition, in code.org angry birds games and other visual
          effects are used so the colour and graphics caught their attention.
          The kids&#39; knowledge about algorithms have improved a lot till the end
          of the lesson. Most have completed all parts and others have explained
          all parts in detail. To summarize everything, we are glad that we
          could impact society positively, and maybe could encourage new
          generations to learn programming.
          <br />
          <br />
          To conclude we want to thank, staff of Baku Young Talents Lyceum for
          the provided support and permission to hold lessons at their school.
